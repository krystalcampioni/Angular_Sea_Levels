# Weather App

This is an AngularJS based app that fetches data from the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/) to display the forecast for 5 european cities.

## Running the Project
This project relies on a webserver to make requests to the Open Weather Map API, in order to retrieve the weather info. Because of that, it's not possible to open an html file in a browser and see the project.

## File structure
The source code is on the `app` folder. This project uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to run several tasks and outputs a final production ready version of the code to the `dist` folder.

* **app/js**
You'll find an `app.js` file that declares the angular module, dependencies and routes. The `controllers`, `directives`, `filters` and `services` are kept in different files.
